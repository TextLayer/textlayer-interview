class Executor:
    """
    Singleton class for executing commands in the command pattern.

    The Executor is a key component in the application's command processing architecture.
    It provides a centralized way to execute both read and write commands, acting as an
    intermediary between controllers (which handle API requests) and commands (which
    contain business logic).

    This design follows the command pattern to ensure:
    - Separation of concerns between request handling and business logic
    - Consistent command execution throughout the application
    - Reusability of commands across different controllers
    - Easier testing of isolated business logic

    The Executor follows the Singleton pattern to ensure only one instance exists
    in the application.

    Example:
        executor = Executor.getInstance()
        result = executor.execute_read(GetUserCommand(user_id=123))
    """

    __instance = None

    @staticmethod

        Creates a new instance if one doesn't exist yet, otherwise returns
        the existing instance.

        Returns:
            Executor: The singleton instance of the Executor class.
